Methods in Java
Methods is just collections of java statements and blocks of code like  if else printlns etc etc.
Why should we learn about methods:
1. it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them.
build those methods one by one nd later on combine them to build the complete application..
2. methods allow us to re-use code.
3. methods allow us to be flexible.
how can we create Methods?
there are two type types build-in and user defined.
Built-in methods?
The methods which are designed by Java developers for example the printLn(0 nextint() method in the scanner class
class length() present in String class they are all built-in methods.
User Defined Methods:
They are methods that we write.
Methods which return something when ewe called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

int add(int a,int b){
return a=B;
}
int  ==>  return type of a method
add  ==> name of the method
(int a,int b)==> parameters of the method or the input to the method
{ ==>body og the method
}
Rules:
return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match
we can only assign methods to variables of the same type.
there are 3 type of variables with respect to their scope
local variables:
if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method,loop,if conditioned etc.They are called LOCAL VARIABLES
upside:
local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.you should always try to write code with the help of local
variable.
downside:
they cant be accessed outside of the block in which they are created. they have very limited scope.
INSTANCE VARIABLES
all the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods are called instance variables.
upside:
we can used them in all the instance methods of tht class.their scoop is larger than local variable.
downside:
they stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables.
STATIC VARIABLES
variable that have that STATIC in,and its always outside of methods...
upside;
static variables only occupy one memory location fro the ram even though we create 100 objects of that class.
they can be used in any block of code inside the class they can be acesed in any methofds og a class.
   they can also be accessed with the help of any object of that class. They have the most wide scope
Downside:
    They are loaded into the memory when a class is loaded even though you don't use them.
    =======================================================================================
    Accees modifiers are some keywords in java that we can use to control the access of the
    variables methods and classes,there are 4 acces levels private protected default public
