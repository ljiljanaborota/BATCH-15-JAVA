super keyword is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors.
when we should used Super or "this' keywords;
when ever same name field or method exists inside the parent and child class.we can use super keyword to explicitly
refer to parent class variables methods or constructors.
NOTE;
By default java prefers local variables  then instance variables from the same class after that the
 instance variables or methods from the parent class
 Method overloading.
method overloading happens when same name method exists ina class with different parameters.we can overload methods in 3 different ways.
1. by changing the number of parameters
2.by changing the data types
3.by changing the sequence of parameters.
Why should we overload method or constructor
  Clean code and flexibility to the end user.
Some important:
    if else conditions
    loops
    arrays
    methods
    String class methods
    inheritance
