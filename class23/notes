Method overriding:
method overriding happens when same method with different implementations exist in parent and child class
why should we override a method:
1.flexibility
when we inherit from a class and if we dont like some methods we can modify them

Rules:
   1) Private methods and constructors can not be overridden because they do not participate in inheritance.
   2) If we want to override something, we must recreate that exact method inside the child class and have a different implementations.
   3) The only change we can make is increasing the visibility in comparison to the parent class
   Note:
   1.right click in editor inside your class and click on generate__> select the fields that
   you want in your constructor and click on done
   2. if we press ctr+0 we get an option to override the available methods
