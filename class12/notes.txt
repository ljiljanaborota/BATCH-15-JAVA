OOP-OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING
ITS just a way of writing code.That's follows certain  rules of guidelines.
we created  classes with attributes/properties/fields and methods/function/behaviours.
We should learn OOP because
1. its simplifies the software development and maintenance-updates(adding new features,changing existing code).
2. code duplications is reduced
3. helps us represent something from real life with help of class
and objects

Scanner is very similar to OOP (creating a class without a main method), and then importing it when we need
 it(cat,dog kind of classes we had).
  Ex.#1 - Cat cat1 = new Cat () ;
  Ex.#2 - Scanner scan = new Scanner (System.in) ;

CLASS:
   Represents a blueprint or a design from which actual real-life objects are created. Computer
   It tells the computer how the dog will look alike, what would be the attributes, behaviors etc.
    all from our different type of classes.


OBJECT:
   An object is an instance of a class. The basic building block of OOP.

METHOD:
   Method is basically a behavior of the object.

Guidelines (Classes etc), everything we are creating is more alike a theory, if we want to put it into the
 real life code, we have to do it through objects.

Way to create:
1)First we create the object of the class.

public static void main {
   Car => name of the class
   bmw = new => object and the new word that created the object.
   Car () ;
Full line: Car bmw = new Car () ;
                       bmw.make = “BMW” ; => ATTRIBUTES
                       bmw.moveForward( ) ; => Method

public static void main & void moveForward () ; are both methods. Whenever we are inside of the method,
the sequence matters. When we are inside of the class, the sequence does not matter, you can define the methods
 first or the properties first.

STRING DEMO:
   The most well used in Java.
String name = new String ( ) ; => This is how we create it an object of the String class. As we type anything
 inside of parathesis it will add original: by itself in the system inside of it before our code.
String name = “Java” ; => Shorter way of creating the same thing above. And mostly, this is how we create the
object of String class.
Coffee machine method:
1)Water, electricity, milk etc. => Input
(processing in between)
2)Coffee(Different types) => Output

TIP:
String name = “Savo Bozovic” ;
if (name.length()>10) {
sout(“The name can not be more than 10 letters!) ;
} => This is what will be printed out.

TIP:
String str = “JAVA is FUN” ;
String newStr = str.toLowerCase () ;
sout (newStr) ;
=> Everything will be printed out in lower case.

String str = “I love java” ;
String newStr = str.toUpperCase () ;
sout (newStr) ;
=> Everything will be printed out in upper case.
